# Raylib

This is a more ruby-like interface for the great [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) library.

## Compile raylib

Raspbian:

```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential git cmake cmake-curses-ui
$ sudo apt install libasound2-dev mesa-common-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git raylib
$ cd raylib/src/
# comment SUPPORT_BUSY_WAIT_LOOP in config.h
$ make -j 4 PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP GRAPHICS=GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL_21 RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
$ sudo make -j 4 PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP GRAPHICS=GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL_21 RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED install
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'raylib'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install raylib

## Usage

Please see the ported [examples](https://github.com/a0/raylib-ruby/tree/master/examples) for usage.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
